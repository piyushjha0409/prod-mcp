## Technical Implementation

### Meeting Preparation Algorithm

1. **Context Gathering**
   - Find similar previous meetings by title keywords
   - Match meetings with same attendees
   - Calculate time until meeting starts
   - Extract meeting participants

2. **Agenda Generation**
   - Use OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent agenda
   - Include meeting duration and participants as context
   - Fallback to template-based agenda

3. **Summary Creation**
   - Post-meeting summaries with action items
   - Structured format: Discussion, Decisions, Actions

### Analytics Algorithm

1. **Data Collection**
   - Fetch events for specified time period
   - Parse start/end times for duration
   - Extract event metadata

2. **Categorization**
   - Classify meetings by keywords in title
   - Group by type (Standup, 1:1, Review, etc.)
   - Count by day of week

3. **Metrics Calculation**
   - Total time = Sum of all event durations
   - Percentage = (Meeting time / Work hours) × 100
   - Averages and aggregations

4. **Recommendations**
   - Rule-based system
   - Industry benchmarks (31% meeting time)
   - Thresholds for warnings (40%, 50%)

## Integration with Previous Phases

### Phase 1 (Calendar)
- Uses CalendarService for event data
- Integrates with existing CRUD operations

### Phase 2 (Smart Scheduling)
- Complements productivity pattern analysis
- Enhances focus time calculations
- Provides deeper insights into calendar usage

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 7 new MCP tools for analytics & prep
- ✅ 3 new Slack commands
- ✅ AI-powered agenda generation
- ✅ Comprehensive weekly/monthly reports
- ✅ Meeting type categorization
- ✅ Actionable recommendations
- ✅ Rich Slack block formatting

## Usage Examples

### Preparing for Next Meeting
```bash
# Slack
/prepmeeting

# Natural language
@bot prepare for my next meeting
@bot meeting prep
```

### Weekly Analytics
```bash
# Slack
/weeklyreport

# Natural language
@bot show me weekly report
@bot how was my calendar this week?
```

### Monthly Trends
```bash
# Slack
/monthlyreport

# Natural language
@bot monthly report
@bot show month analytics
```

## Recommendations System

The analytics service provides intelligent recommendations:

### Critical (>50% meeting time)
- Strong warning
- Immediate action suggested

### Warning (>40% meeting time)
- Comparison to industry average
- Reduction target suggested

### High Meeting Count (>25/week)
- Batching suggestion
- Deep work day recommendation

### Daily Overload (>6 meetings/day)
- Redistribution advice
- Load balancing tips

### Type-Specific
- Too many standups → reduce frequency
- Too many reviews → batch them
- Unbalanced distribution → optimize

## API Integration

All Phase 3 features are accessible via:

1. **Slack Bot** - Commands and natural language
2. **MCP Tools** - Programmatic access
3. **Direct Service Calls** - TypeScript API

## Known Limitations

1. **Slack Message Search** - Placeholder implementation (needs Slack API integration)
2. **OpenAI Dependency** - Falls back to templates when unavailable
3. **Single User** - Analytics for individual, not team
4. **30-Day History** - Limited historical analysis period

## Future Enhancements

### V2 Features
- Real Slack message search integration
- Team-wide analytics and comparisons
- Custom recommendation rules
- Automated weekly email reports
- Meeting effectiveness scoring

### V3 Features
- ML-based meeting prediction
- Automatic meeting notes from transcripts
- Integration with Zoom/Meet for recordings
- Calendar optimization suggestions
- Smart meeting cancellation

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start bot
npm run slack-bot

# Test in Slack
/weeklyreport
/monthlyreport
/prepmeeting
@bot show weekly report
@bot prepare for next meeting
```

### Expected Results
- Weekly report shows current week metrics
- Monthly report includes weekly breakdown
- Meeting prep shows agenda and context
- Recommendations are relevant and actionable

## Performance

- **Weekly Report** - ~2-3s (depends on event count)
- **Monthly Report** - ~5-8s (4 weeks of data)
- **Meeting Prep** - ~3-5s (with OpenAI) or ~1s (fallback)
- **Analytics Calculations** - O(n) where n = number of events
