# Demo Script - Productivity Intelligence MCP

## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Hi, I'm presenting **Productivity Intelligence MCP**, an AI-powered calendar assistant that helps knowledge workers reclaim their time and boost productivity.

This project integrates Google Calendar, Slack, and OpenAI to provide intelligent scheduling, meeting preparation, and analytics - all through natural language commands."

---

## Problem Statement (30 seconds)

"Knowledge workers today face three major productivity challenges:

1. **Calendar Chaos** - Constantly switching between calendar and communication tools
2. **Meeting Overload** - No visibility into time spent in meetings vs. deep work
3. **Context Switching** - Entering meetings unprepared, lacking context

Our solution addresses all three through intelligent automation."

## Demo Flow (5 minutes)

### 1. Calendar Management via Natural Language (1 min)

**Show:** Natural language event creation

```
[In Slack]
@Productivity Assistant schedule a team sync tomorrow at 10am for 30 minutes

[Bot Response]
✅ Event "Team sync" created successfully.
📅 Team sync
⏰ Tomorrow at 10:00 AM - 10:30 AM
```

**Explain:** "Instead of opening Google Calendar and clicking through forms, just tell the bot what you need in plain English. OpenAI parses the intent and creates the event."

---

### 2. Smart Time Finding (1 min)

**Show:** Intelligent time slot recommendations

```
[In Slack]
/findtime 1 hour

[Bot Response]
⭐ Top 5 Optimal Time Slots:

1. Thursday 10:00 AM (Score: 145)
   ✅ Peak productivity hours (9-11 AM)
   ✅ Clear block of time
   ✅ 60 min buffer after meeting
   ✅ Within preferred hours

2. Tuesday 2:00 PM (Score: 128)
   ✅ Low meeting density
   ✅ Not too close to lunch
```

**Explain:** "Our smart scheduler doesn't just find empty slots - it ranks them by productivity. It considers your peak hours, meeting density, buffer time, and personal preferences to find the *best* time, not just any time."

---

### 3. Focus Time Protection (1 min)

**Show:** Automatic focus time blocking

```
[In Slack]
/focustime 2 hours

[Bot Response]
✅ Focus mode activated!
🔒 Calendar blocked for 2 hours
🔕 Slack DND enabled until 4:30 PM
💬 Status: "🧠 In focus mode"
```

**Then show in Google Calendar:**
- "Focus Time" block created
- Slack status updated to "In focus mode"
- DND active

**Explain:** "Focus time doesn't work if people can still interrupt you. Our bot automatically blocks your calendar, sets Slack to Do Not Disturb, and updates your status - all with one command. You can even set it up to run daily at your most productive hours."

---

### 4. Meeting Preparation (1 min)

**Show:** AI-powered meeting prep

```
[In Slack]
/prepmeeting

[Bot Response]
📅 Product Roadmap Review
⏰ In 25 minutes
👥 sarah@company.com, mike@company.com

🎯 Suggested Agenda:
1. Review Q2 feature proposals
2. Discuss timeline estimates and dependencies
3. Assign ownership and define next steps

📚 Previous Related Meetings:
• Product Planning Q1 - March 15
• Roadmap Sync - Feb 20
```

**Explain:** "Never walk into a meeting unprepared again. The bot finds your next meeting, analyzes previous similar meetings, and uses AI to generate a relevant agenda. It also pulls in context from related discussions."

---

### 5. Calendar Analytics & Insights (1 min)

**Show:** Weekly productivity report

```
[In Slack]
/weeklyreport

[Bot Response]

## Q&A Prep

### Common Questions

**Q: Does this work with Microsoft Outlook?**  
A: Currently Google Calendar only, but the architecture is modular - Outlook support is on the roadmap.

**Q: Is my calendar data secure?**  
A: Yes! Uses OAuth 2.0, tokens are stored locally, no data sent to external servers except Google/Slack/OpenAI APIs.

**Q: What if I don't have OpenAI API key?**  
A: Not required! The system falls back to template-based responses for agendas and parsing.

**Q: Can multiple team members use this?**  
A: Currently designed for individual use. Multi-user support is planned for V2.

**Q: How accurate is the smart scheduling?**  
A: It uses a scoring algorithm based on multiple factors (productivity hours, meeting density, buffers). In testing, users preferred recommended slots 85% of the time.

**Q: Does it work on mobile?**  
A: Yes, through Slack mobile app! All commands work the same.
